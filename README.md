## Introduction

This repository houses a collection of JSON policies designed to enforce DISA compliance standards for Kubernetes clusters. The policies provided here are intended to help organizations ensure that their Kubernetes deployments adhere to DISA security requirements.

## Kyverno Policies

The `kyverno` folder contains Kyverno policies in JSON format. These policies are used to enforce DISA compliance rules within Kubernetes clusters.

## Kubernetes Policies

The `k8s` folder contains Kubernetes policies in JSON format. These policies are also designed to enforce DISA compliance rules, but they are applied directly to Kubernetes resources.

## Docker Folder

The `docker` folder may contain additional resources related to Docker, such as Dockerfiles or scripts. However, in this repository, it contains Kyverno JSON policies specific to Docker containers.

## K8s Folder

The `k8s` folder contains Kubernetes-specific resources, including Kubernetes policy files and configurations.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have additional Kyverno or Kubernetes policies that enforce DISA compliance or improvements to existing policies, feel free to submit a pull request.
